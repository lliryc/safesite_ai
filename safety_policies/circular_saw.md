### Safety Rules for Working with a Circular Saw

#### Pre-Use Inspection and Setup

1. **Conduct a Pre-Use Inspection:**
   - Inspect the saw for any damage or defects before each use.
   - Check the blade for sharpness, damage, and proper alignment.
   - Ensure the blade guard is functioning correctly and moves freely.

2. **Ensure Proper Electrical Setup:**
   - Use a grounded outlet and ensure the power cord is in good condition.
   - Avoid using extension cords; if necessary, use a heavy-duty, short extension cord.

3. **Secure the Work Area:**
   - Clear the work area of debris, obstructions, and tripping hazards.
   - Ensure there is adequate lighting to see the workpiece and cutting line clearly.
   - Set up a stable, flat surface for cutting and secure the workpiece with clamps or a vise.

#### Personal Protective Equipment (PPE)

4. **Wear Appropriate PPE:**
   - Use safety glasses or a face shield to protect your eyes from flying debris.
   - Wear hearing protection, such as earplugs or earmuffs, to protect against noise.
   - Use a dust mask or respirator to avoid inhaling sawdust.
   - Wear snug-fitting clothing, and avoid loose clothing, jewelry, or long hair that can get caught in the saw.

#### Operating the Saw

5. **Read the Manufacturer’s Instructions:**
   - Familiarize yourself with the circular saw’s operation manual.
   - Follow all manufacturer guidelines for safe operation.

6. **Use the Right Blade for the Job:**
   - Select the appropriate blade for the material you are cutting.
   - Ensure the blade is securely fastened and properly aligned.

7. **Maintain a Firm Grip:**
   - Hold the saw with both hands for maximum control.
   - Keep a firm grip on the saw at all times and maintain a stable stance.

8. **Check Blade Guard Functionality:**
   - Ensure the blade guard covers the blade when the saw is not in use.
   - Never disable or remove the blade guard.

9. **Position the Saw Correctly:**
   - Line up the saw blade with the cutting line before starting the saw.
   - Ensure the base plate is flat against the material being cut.

10. **Make Safe Cuts:**
    - Start the saw before making contact with the material.
    - Allow the saw to reach full speed before beginning the cut.
    - Keep the saw moving forward at a steady pace without forcing it.
    - Avoid cutting through nails, knots, or other obstructions in the material.

#### Safety Practices During Operation

11. **Keep Hands and Fingers Safe:**
    - Keep hands and fingers away from the cutting line and blade path.
    - Use push sticks or guides to keep hands away from the blade when making narrow cuts.

12. **Avoid Kickback:**
    - Maintain a firm grip and control of the saw to prevent kickback.
    - Do not force the saw; let the blade do the cutting.
    - Use a riving knife or splitter to prevent the material from pinching the blade.

13. **Allow the Blade to Stop:**
    - Let the blade come to a complete stop before removing the saw from the material.
    - Do not set the saw down until the blade has stopped spinning.

14. **Disconnect Power When Not in Use:**
    - Unplug the saw when changing blades, making adjustments, or when not in use.
    - Ensure the saw is off before connecting or disconnecting the power supply.

#### Post-Use Procedures

15. **Clean and Store the Saw Properly:**
    - Clean the saw and remove any sawdust or debris after use.
    - Inspect the saw for any damage or wear before storing.
    - Store the saw in a dry, secure place out of reach of children.

16. **Maintain Regular Maintenance:**
    - Follow the manufacturer’s recommendations for regular maintenance and lubrication.
    - Replace worn or damaged parts promptly.

By adhering to these detailed safety rules, the risks associated with using a circular saw can be significantly reduced, ensuring a safer work environment for all personnel involved.
